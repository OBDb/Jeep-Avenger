    description: "The Jeep Avenger is the brand's first all-electric SUV and smallest model, designed primarily for the European market. Built on Stellantis' e-CMP platform shared with vehicles like the Peugeot e-2008 and Opel Mokka-e, it features distinctive Jeep styling cues including the seven-slot grille (closed for aerodynamics on electric versions), trapezoidal wheel arches, and rugged body cladding, albeit in a more compact package than traditional Jeep models. At just 4.08 meters long, it's positioned below the Renegade in size, optimized for urban European environments while maintaining Jeep's adventurous spirit. Initially launched as a battery electric vehicle with a single front-mounted motor producing 154 HP (115 kW) and 260 Nm of torque, paired with a 54 kWh battery providing approximately 400 km (249 miles) of range on the WLTP cycle. A 100 kW DC fast charging capability allows a 20-80% charge in around 24 minutes. The lineup later expanded to include a 1.2L turbocharged petrol engine with mild-hybrid technology for markets where EV infrastructure is still developing. Despite being front-wheel drive only at launch (unusual for a Jeep), it offers respectable off-road specifications for its class, including 200mm ground clearance, 20° approach angle, and 32° departure angle, plus a Selec-Terrain system with Snow, Sand, and Mud modes. The interior combines rugged Jeep design elements with modern technology, featuring a 10.25-inch touchscreen infotainment system, 10.25-inch digital instrument cluster, and practical storage solutions including a 34-liter total front storage capacity. As Jeep's first purpose-built electric vehicle and European-focused model, the Avenger represents an important step in the brand's global electrification strategy, evidenced by it winning the 2023 European Car of the Year award—the first Jeep to receive this honor."
